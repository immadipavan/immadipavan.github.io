  Welcome to my website showing the example of bad User Interface! As you navigate through this website, you may notice several design choices that make it difficult to use and frustrating to interact with. The purpose of this website is to showcase common mistakes that can lead to poor user experience and to help you understand why they should be avoided. Some of the problems you may encounter include inconsistent visual elements, confusing navigation, and cluttered or overwhelming layouts. By highlighting these issues, I hope to raise awareness of the importance of good UI design and inspire others to create interfaces that are intuitive, efficient, and easy to use.
